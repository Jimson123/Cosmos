It's a Gradle project, an Android app.
Use Gradle to build it with Java API 30.
We have tested this project for API 30 and used a Pixel2 for testing.

Cosmos (first published 1980) by Carl Sagan explores the history of the universe, science, and our understanding of the world.
Our Android app contains significantly less history of the universe, science, and understanding of the world.

Your task is to guide a rocket through each level without blowing up and with the least amount of clicks.
Each level ends by having the rocket reach the moon.
Most Importantly have fun!!!
